This lecture course offers a non-technical exploration of its foundational principles, inherent strengths and limitations, and a comprehensive overview of its profound impact on our society and economy. We will delve into critical questions: How will AI reshape labor markets and jobs? What roles will it play in medical research, healthcare, education, entertainment, engineering, transportation, and the legal system? How will it be used - or misused - in democratic societies and autocratic regimes? Will it alter the geopolitical balance of power and the nature of warfare? How can we align these powerful systems with human values? Can machines genuinely create, or possess consciousness? Does the prospect of superintelligence mean the human race is doomed? Will the benefits of this technological revolution be broadly distributed, or accrue to a lucky few? Are we currently experiencing an 'AI bubble'? This course also demystifies essential jargon, such as 'transformers', 'prompt engineering', 'chain of thought', 'hallucination', 'jailbreaking', 'context rot', 'deepfakes', 'stochastic parrots', and 'algorithmic bias'. By equipping students with historical grounding, intellectual tools, ethical frameworks, and psychological perspectives, this course prepares them to thoughtfully navigate the complexities of the AI revolution.

In considering the possible implications for education, ChatGPT has sparked dreams of automated personal tutors, customizable teaching assistance, AI-led collaborative learning, and revolutions in assessment. In addition to optimistic projections, there are clear and significant risks. For example, will AI-assisted learning be culturally appropriate and equally available to all? Can it increase opportunity for underprivileged learners worldwide, or will it accentuate privilege and privileged views?  Will it help us learn faster, or distract us from thinking deeply about difficult problems ourselves?

    "description": "This is the introductory prerequisite course in the computer graphics sequence which introduces students to the technical concepts behind creating synthetic computer generated images. The beginning of the course focuses on using Blender to create visual imagery, as well as an understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts including triangles, normals, interpolation, texture mapping, bump mapping, etc. Then we move on to a more fundamental understanding of light and color, as well as how it impacts computer displays and printers. From this we discuss more thoroughly how light interacts with the environment, and we construct engineering models such as the BRDF and discuss various simplifications into more basic lighting and shading models. Finally, we discuss ray tracing technology for creating virtual images, while drawing parallels between ray tracers and real world cameras in order to illustrate various concepts. Anti-aliasing and acceleration structures are also discussed. The final class project consists of building out a ray tracer to create a visually compelling image. Starter codes and code bits will be provided here and there to aid in development, but this class focuses on what you can do with the code as opposed to what the code itself looks like. Therefore grading is weighted towards in person \"demos\" of the code in action - creativity and the production of impressive visual imagery are highly encouraged.This is the first course in the computer graphics sequence at Stanford. Topics include: Scanline Rendering; Triangles; Rasterization; Transformations; Shading; Triangle Meshes; Subdivision; Marching Cubes; Textures; Light; Color; Cameras; Displays; Tone Mapping; BRDF; Lighting Equation; Global Illumination; Radiosity; Ray Tracing; Acceleration Structures; Sampling; Antialiasing; Reflection; Transmission; Depth of Field; Motion Blur; Monte Carlo; Bidirectional Ray Tracing; Light Maps.",

These questions ask whether advanced AI systems (today, often large language models - LLMs) can be moral agents - whether they are the kind of thing that can know how to make (ethically) correct decisions, and be held responsible for the rights or wrongs they do. Asking these questions leads us to questions about ourselves: What about us makes us moral agents? Is it our reason? Or is it essential that we emotionally feel each others' pain? Is selfishness irrational, or just unpleasant? Understanding ourselves can help us think about what kinds of artificial minds we would like to make, and, if we can, how. In this class, we provide the philosophical rigor and technical background necessary to robustly interrogate these and related questions.

    "description": "Businesses are built on ideas. Today's successful companies are those that most effectively generate, protect, and exploit new and valuable business ideas. Over the past 40 years, intellectual capital has emerged as the leading assets class.  Ocean Tomo\u00ae estimates that over 80% of the market value of S&P 500 corporations now stems from intangible assets, which consist largely of intellectual property (IP) assets (e.g., the company and product names, logos and designs; patentable inventions; proprietary software and databases, and other proprietary product, manufacturing and marketing information). It is therefore vital for entrepreneurs and other business professionals to have a basic understanding of IP and how it is procured, protected, and exploited. This course provides an overview of the many and varied IP issues that students will confront during their careers. It is intended to be both informative and fun. Classes will cover the basics of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret law. Current issues in these areas will be covered, including patent protection for software and business methods, copyrightability of computer programs and APIs, issues relating to artificial intelligence, and the evolving protection for trademarks and trade secrets.  Emerging issues concerning the federal Computer Fraud & Abuse Act (CFAA) and hacking will be covered, as will employment issues, including employee proprietary information and invention assignment agreements, work made for hire agreements, confidentiality agreements, non-compete agreements and other potential post-employment restrictions. Recent notable lawsuits will be discussed, including Apple v. Samsung (patents), Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank (software and business method patents), Oracle v. Google (software/APIs), Waymo v. Uber (civil and criminal trade secret theft), and hiQ v. LinkedIn (CFAA). IP law evolves constantly and new headline cases that arise during the term are added to the class discussion. Guest lectures typically include experts on open source software; legal and practical issues confronted by business founders; and, consulting and testifying as an expert in IP litigation. Although many of the issues discussed will involve technology disputes, the course also covers IP issues relating to art, music, photography, and literature. Classes are presented in an open discussion format and they are designed to be enjoyed by students of all backgrounds and areas of expertise.",

This progress, however, raises (and is impeded by) a host of concerns regarding the societal impact of computation. A prominent concern is that these algorithms should be fair. Unfortunately, the hope that automated decision-making might be free of social biases is dashed on the data on which the algorithms are trained and the choices in their construction: left to their own devices, algorithms will propagate - even amplify - existing biases of the data, the programmers, and the decisions made in the choice of features to incorporate and measurements of 'fitness' to be applied. Addressing wrongful discrimination by algorithms is not only mandated by law and by ethics but is essential to maintaining the public trust in the current computation-driven revolution.The study of fairness is ancient and multi-disciplinary: philosophers, legal experts, economists, statisticians, social scientists and others have been concerned with fairness for as long as these fields have existed. Nevertheless, the scale of decision making in the age of big-data, the computational complexities of algorithmic decision making, and simple professional responsibility mandate that computer scientists contribute to this research endeavor. This is an intro to this booming area of research. Prerequisites: CS 161. I will be assuming some mathematical maturity, CS 154 is recommended.",

    "description": "This project-based class focuses on understanding the use of technology in the world. Students will learn generative and evaluative research methods to explore how systems are appropriated into everyday life in a quarter-long project where they design, implement and evaluate a novel mobile application. Quantitative (e.g. A/B testing, instrumentation, analytics, surveys) and qualitative (e.g. diary studies, contextual inquiry, ethnography) methods and their combination will be covered along with practical experience applying these methods in their project. Prerequisites: CS 147, 193A/193P (or equivalent mobile programming experience).",

    "description": "This graduate seminar provides an exploration of the rapidly evolving field of internet censorship and the sophisticated techniques developed to measure its extent and circumvent its mechanisms. The course is built upon a foundation of active engagement with classic and seminal research literature. A significant and defining component is a quarter-long research project where students will either replicate a key finding from existing literature or explore a novel research direction. The overarching goal is to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the global censorship ecosystem, the technical skills to analyze its mechanism, and the critical thinking skills necessary to contribute meaningfully to the field. Prerequisites: Recommended background includes graduate standing, strong knowledge of computer networking (CS144/244), or computer security (CS155/255).",
