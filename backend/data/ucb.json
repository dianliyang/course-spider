Is the application welfare-enhancing and stable (not a source of systemic risk). How do the new and old systems interact? We aim for the students to be able to critically evaluate whether a new DeFi protocol is novel and practical.

This course is not just a timeline of computing milestones, but a multidisciplinary exploration of the people, ideas, and cultural forces that shaped our digital world today. Whether deeply embedded in computer science or just beginning to explore its foundations, this class offers a rich perspective on how computing evolved in tandem with the shifting tides of human history.\n\nMoving chronologically, we begin with early logical systems and ancient tools of calculation, and trace a path through the Industrial Revolution, world wars, Cold War, the space race, the rise of personal computing, and the emergence of the internet and artificial intelligence. At each stage, we examine how technological progress was shaped by the cultural, political, and economic conditions of its time. From Babbage\u2019s engines born out of a desire for mathematical precision in Victorian England to the birth of ARPANET during the geopolitical tension of the\nlate 20th century, we uncover how computing has always been entangled with broader societal currents.\n\nThis course blends hardware and theory, philosophy and engineering, invention and infrastructure. We will read the words of thinkers like Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing, study the systems they imagined, and reflect on how the contributions of overlooked voices have steered\ntechnological development. Through weekly readings, primary source analysis, and discussion, you will engage with computing not only as a technical discipline but also as a historical phenomenon rooted in human needs and shaped by human values.\n\nBy the end, you will understand how we arrived at the systems and devices we depend on today, why those systems came to be, and how they reflect the time and place in which they were created. Join us for an exploration of the history of computing that is as much about people and culture as it is about machines and algorithms.",

Groups will then spend the rest of the semester working to complete a roughly 30-second short film using Autodesk Maya.\n\u25cf There are two distinct sections to this course, one on Monday and one on Friday. Students must register for one of these two sections, and then attend that section for the rest of the semester. Students will not be allowed to switch sections after registration.\n\u25cf Every class will begin with a short lecture introducing a new concept of 3D animation. Students will then work through an online tutorial which will help them learn to put this new concept into practice. After completing this tutorial, students will be encouraged to work on their projects in class with the help of facilitators.",

    "description": "This graduate seminar is an interdisciplinary introduction to the individual, social, economic, and political effects of AI-driven media, with particular emphasis on design approaches that grapple with these issues. Social media is an important application, but we are also concerned with LLMs and systems like news recommenders, online shopping, job listings, and \u201ctrending\u201d algorithms. \n\nWe will start with the basic question of \u201cwho should see what when?\u201d and from there to the social science of recommender effects, algorithmic approaches to grapple with them. Topics include a taxonomy of benefits and harms, models of preference and utility, alignment and optimization, causal inference of user effects, well-being, addiction, polarization and conflict, diversity, filter bubbles and rabbit holes, fairness in information retrieval, incorporation of non-engagement signals into ranking, and the design of user controls. \n\nSome topics require technical background (computer science or quantitative social science) but students from all related fields are invited to attend.",

    "description": "Robotics has been late to the deep learning revolution compared to computer vision and natural language processing, mainly because \u201dbig data\u201d is not so readily available. However significant advances have been made in the last few years, and the purpose of this class is to present a coherent framework for studying these advances.\n\nMy goal is to build machines that can emulate the remarkable capabilities of humans and other animals at motor control, defined as connecting perception to action in the physical world. Hence there will be a distinct preference for legs over wheels, multi-finger hands over parallel jaw grippers, rich visual and tactile perception over minimal sensing, humanoid robots in the home\nover specialist robots on the factory floor. The course itself will have three main parts:\n\n(1) biological motor control basics for inspiration\n(2) main paradigms for robot motor skill acquisition\n(3) case studies of locomotion, navigation and manipulation.\n\nThis is a graduate level class, and prerequisite knowledge at the level of Deep Learning (Bishop & Bishop), and Reinforcement Learning (Sutton & Barto) will be assumed.\n\nIntroduction\nBiomechanics of walking and running\nRobot mechanisms - kinematics and dynamics\nThe human hand and dexterous object manipulation\nProprioception and tactile perception\nVision for action\nComputational neuroscience perspective on prediction and control\nThe developmental perspective on motor control\nClassical robotics approaches- MPC, SLAM, TAMP\nReinforcement Learning\nBehavior cloning\nVisual Imitation\nCase Studies in Locomotion\nCase Studies in Navigation\nCase Studies in Dexterous Manipulation\nLong horizon planning and the role of language\nAdditional topics based on class interest",

    "description": "Advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by the growing availability of large and diverse datasets. But where do these datasets come from? How are they being used? How can we leverage them in better, more creative ways? What challenges or issues do they present, and how might we address them? In this seminar, we will explore these questions as part of a broader effort to rethink how data is used in the development of LLMs: what data we use, how we use it, why it works, and what problems it brings.\n\nThe class is primarily designed for PhD students and is based on paper readings, discussions, and an open-ended project. Students are expected to independently understand assigned papers and have a background in ML, NLP (CS 288 or equivalent), and LLMs.",

    "description": "In classical information theory, information is stored and measured in bits, and all bits are equal in cost and value. In quantum information theory, information is stored in tensors, which vary considerably in their cost and value. Neither is properly understood. Matrix multiplication is the fundamental operation of linear algebra. In research on the complexity of matrix multiplication one confronts the same issue of cost and value of tensors. Historically, cost has been approached using tools from algebraic geometry and representation theory, while value has been approached using tools from analysis, probability, and combinatorics. I will present all these perspectives and attempt to bring them together. Nothing beyond undergraduate level mathematics will be assumed. \n\nPlan I. History and background \u2014 matrix multiplication complexity, quantum information theory, and the role of tensors. Basic definitions regarding tensors. Other problems where cost and value of tensors arise (Fourier analysis, structure v. randomness, additive combinatorics). \n\nII. Value \u2014 review of relevant probability and information theory. Measures of value and their uses. Strassen's functionals and their recent quantum analogs (work of Christandl, Vrana, and Zuiddam), including the relevant representation theory needed to define them. Work of Cohen and Moshkovitz on partition and analytic rank, and of Derksen on G-stable rank. Work of Chang, Derksen, Draisma and others on generic subrank. Measures of entanglement. \n\nIII. Cost \u2014 lower bounds for the complexity of matrix multiplication. Relevant representation theory and algebraic geometry needed to prove the lower bounds. Recent work on tensors of minimal cost. Connections to classical problems in linear algebra (spaces of commuting matrices, spaces of bounded rank). Recent work of Buczynska, Buczynski, Conner, Jelisiejew, Gesmundo, Harper, Huang, Landsberg, Mandziuk, and Sivic.",
